We have scheduled our weekly meetings to take place every <span style='color:#B509AC'>Thursday</span> from <span style='color:#B509AC'>2:00 PM</span> to <span style='color:#B509AC'>3:30 PM</span> at <span style='color:#B509AC'>B13 MLH</span>. During these sessions, we will be presenting and discussing papers that encompass a wide range of topics falling under the umbrella of Algorithms and Theoretical Computer Science. We extend a warm invitation to all of you to join us in these engaging discussions. Kindly make a note of these dates in your calendars if you intend to participate. Your presence will be greatly appreciated.

This semester, there is no single focal theme. Participants are free to choose and present any paper of interest within the broad scope of algorithms.
