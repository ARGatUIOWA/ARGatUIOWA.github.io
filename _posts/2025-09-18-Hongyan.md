**Abstract**:  Graph spanners have been extensively studied in the literature of graph algorithms. In an undirected weighted graph $$G = (V, E, \omega)$$ on $$n$$ vertices, a $$t$$-spanner of $$G$$ is a subgraph that preserves pairwise distances up to a multiplicative stretch factor of $$t$$. It is well-known that, for any integer $$k$$, a $$(2k - 1)$$-spanner with $$O(n^{1+1/k})$$ edges always exists, and the stretch-sparsity balance is tight under the girth conjecture by Erdos. In this paper, we are interested in efficient algorithms for spanners in the distributed setting. Specifically, we present constant-round congested clique algorithms for spanners with nearly optimal stretch-sparsity trade-offs: $$(2k-1)$$-spanners with $$O(n^{1+1/k})$$ edges in unweighted graphs (i.e. $$\omega \equiv 1$$). $$(1 + \epsilon) (2k - 1)$$-spanners with $$O(n^{1+1/k})$$ edges in weighted graphs. $$(2k-1)$$-spanners with $$O(kn^{1+1/k})$$ edges in weighted graphs.
