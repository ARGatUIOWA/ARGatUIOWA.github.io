**Abstract**:  We study the awake complexity of graph problems that belong to the class O-LOCAL, which includes a subset of problems solvable by sequential greedy algorithms, such as $$(\Delta+1)$$-coloring and maximal independent set. It is known from previous work that, in $$n$$-node graphs of maximum degree $$\Delta$$, any problem in the class O-LOCAL can be solved by a deterministic distributed algorithm with awake complexity $$O(\log\Delta+\log^\star n)$$.
In this paper, we show that any problem belonging to the class O-LOCAL can be solved by a deterministic distributed algorithm with awake complexity $$O(\sqrt{\log n}\cdot\log^\star n)$$. This leads to a polynomial improvement over the state of the art when $$\Delta\gg 2^{\sqrt{\log n}}$$, e.g., $$\Delta=n^\epsilon$$ for some arbitrarily small $$\epsilon>0$$. The key ingredient for achieving our results is the computation of a network decomposition, that uses a small-enough number of colors, in sub-logarithmic time in the Sleeping model, which can be of independent interest.
